# geotwit

## Motivation
Analysis of data from social media, such as Twitter, can be extremely useful in disaster management or analyzing outbreaks, analyzing localized trending topics. People use platforms like twitter to discuss trending topics, talk about what's happening in recent times etc. With the motivation to visualize trending topics on social media, we are developing the geoTwit app to be able to display the use of specific keywords at different location. There are certain local phrases which are used by people in specific region. This app will allow users to view the use of certain keyphrases at different geographic locations.


## Example use case

## Further Development and comments

* Identification of trending words can be improved by implementing clustering of documents (tweets) for tfid vectorizer.
