## Motivation
Analysis of data from social media, such as Twitter, can be extremely useful in disaster management or analyzing outbreaks, analyzing localized trending topics. People use platforms like twitter for discussion, talk about what's happening in recent times etc. With the motivation to visualize trending phrases or topics on social media, we are developing this geoTwit app to be able to display the use of specific phrases at different location in US. There are certain local phrases which are used by people in specific region and can be visualized using the frequency of a phrase in collection of tweets. This app will allow users to view the use of certain keyphrases at different geographic locations. User would be able to enter their own list of keywords or our app will recommend top ranked phrases. For visualizing the tweets we are using kepler.gl tool.
